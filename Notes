Todo:
	Code to get card
		If timeout, send an error message and render a error html.
		Note : Store the timeout time in constants
	Write error.html
	Write submitrating.html
	Write thankyou.html
	Write start.html
		Note : error.html and thankyou.html will have javascript that will redirect to start.html
	Migrate the models!!!

Note1:
	Need to read roll numbers from cards in ReadView.get()
	If User.DoesNotExist is raised, need to save RFID and Rollno before sending a error message.
	This way, hostel authorities will be able to know which RFID is which person in the admin site - by looking at the roll numbers.

Notes : 
	Admin site - check which stuff should be editable and which stuff should not be editable
		User and Group objects should not be visible at all
		In Profile object,
			User should not be visible
			RFID and Rollno should not be editable
			Name, Resident Hostel and Subscribed Hostel should be editable
			__str__ should be in "name(rollno)" format
		Profile creation should be disabled
		In Activity Object,
			We need a hostel field which should be automatically taken from profile.subscribed_hostel
			User should not be visible
			User.Profile.name should be visible
			Rating should not be editable
		Activity creation should be disabled

	New Card - automatic reg of rfid and rollno
	Feedback once per meal
	Django date and time is wrong
