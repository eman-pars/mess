Made necessary changes in the django and committed them
	Activity model and RatingView view

Cleaned databases and reset migrations in pi

Tried to connect screen and reader at same time and work. 
It does not work. 
Basically, the dtoverlays for waveshare35a and spi1-3cs are conflicting in /boot/config.txt
Need to figure this out

Basically, the device tree overlays of SPI Bus 1 and Waveshare 3.5 inch display are conflicting.
	dtoverlay=spi1-3cs 
	dtoverlay=waveshare35a
The overlay files are stored in /boot/overlays. But they are unreadable device tree blob (dtbo) files that are created by compiling/building device tree source (dts) files
I tried to find the device tree source files for these. And I did - kind of.

	https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.9.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/spi1-3cs-overlay.dts
	https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.9.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/sc16is752-spi1-overlay.dts
However, I am unable to make any sense of the source so far......

Another option is to not rely on kernel devices for both SPIO and SPI1.
Which means using some GPIO library + userspace code to communicate with 3.5 inch screen or mfrc522 via SPI.
For MFRC522, we already found PIGPIO and the user's code - but using that now feels like giving up.

I found several other nice libraries, but either they didnt work, or had some minor bug which makes them useless.
	This library works amazing for reading touch input - but its only for touch. Not for display.

	Ideally, this should work for display, but I havent figured out how to use it yet.

	This is pretty much the same as the previous one.. And I didnt look too far into this - since it required me to wire the pins of the display, and I dont have spare jumpers..

	This is the blog of the guy who wrote the gfxlcd library - and its awesome
